## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### I created my handle, but I canâ€™t connect

_When the Linea network is massively used, our RPC endpoints might have trouble handling the load. This leads to some transactions not being indexed by the Lens ðŸŒ¿ API, and your handle might not be taken into account by Lineaster._

1. Iâ€™ve created a handle, I own the token associated to it
2. When I try to log into Lineaster, Iâ€™m asked to create a handle, but an error says I already have one
3. First solution is to use another Ethereum address and start the process from scratch
4. Second solution is to get rid of the token you got from the first handle creation:
5. Go to [Zonic](https://testnet.zonic.app/profile?filter=%7B%22tab%22:0,%22chain%22:59140%7D) marketplace testnet
6. Select the token representing your Lineaster handle
7. Transfer it to another address (for example `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
8. Create your handle once again from [Lineaster](https://lineaster.goerli.linea.build/)

### I created a post, but it is not displayed

_When the Linea network is massively used, our RPC endpoints might have trouble handling the load. This leads to some transactions not being indexed by the Lens ðŸŒ¿ API, and your post not being picked up by Lineaster._

1. Iâ€™ve created a post, but it is not displayed on my profileâ€™s feed
2. Please create a new post, for it to be indexed successfully this time

### I created a post, but it stays in an â€˜indexingâ€™ state

_When the Linea network is massively used, our RPC endpoints might have trouble handling the load. This leads to some transactions not being indexed by the Lens ðŸŒ¿ API, and your post not being picked up by Lineaster._

1. Iâ€™ve created a post, but it is displayed as â€˜indexingâ€™ on the homepage for more than 1 hour
2. You can clean your publications pending for indexation via your [Cleanup](https://lineaster.goerli.linea.build/settings/cleanup) menu
3. Please create a new post, for it to be indexed successfully this time

### I need some USDC to complete the tasks, where can I get some?

_As we are on a testnet, you can get test tokens such as USDC easily._

1. Go to the Linea testnet faucet: [ _https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/_](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/)
2. Lock some ETH to get USDC in exchange
